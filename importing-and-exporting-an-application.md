Airkit allows apps to be imported and exported, regardless of which [Org](doc:airkit-organizations) they were originally built in. This allows apps to be shared across Orgs. It also serves as a means to clone or otherwise duplicate applications within a single Org.

Exporting an Application
------------------------


To export an application.


1. Open the app by clicking on “Edit in Studio”![mceclip0.png](./assets_v1714/importing-and-exporting-an-application-v1714-0.png)
2. Click on the three-lined button on the top left side of the Console and then on **Export**

5. Save the app to finish the import process.  


You can now edit, deploy, or preview the application!


**Note:** When you import an application that has [App Objects](https://support.airkit.com/docs/airdata-app-objects) associated, you must save the application when in the studio in order to initiate the migration.
