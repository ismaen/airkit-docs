Portals are dashboards that make it possible to view and edit data stored in [Airdata](https://support.airkit.com/docs/airdata) without accessing anything under the hood. Most Portals are built out for use by teammates that have been assigned the [role](https://support.airkit.com/docs/managing-user-roles) of Agent, which does not grant them permission to work within [Airkit Studio](https://support.airkit.com/docs/studio)Â proper.
