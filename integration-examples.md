[Airkit makes it easy to integrate your APIs and other systems with your applications](https://support.airkit.com/docs/your-apis-and-systems-connect-to-airkit). With all of your favorite platforms so accessible, you can consolidate existing processes as well as seamlessly combine different platforms' functionalities in novel ways. Some of the most prevalent platforms, including Google, [Zendesk](https://support.airkit.com/docs/zendesk-integration), [Salesforce](https://support.airkit.com/docs/create-a-salesforce-lead), [Stripe](https://support.airkit.com/docs/creating-a-stripe-integration), and [Twilio](https://support.airkit.com/docs/connecting-your-twilio-numbers-to-airkit), come with streamlined connections pre-built into every application, but you're not at all limited to the commonplace integrations. It's possible to connect your Airkit apps to just about any system or external data source you like, whether you're [authenticating via OAuth, an API Token, HTTP Basic Auth, a custom token, or SFTP](https://support.airkit.com/docs/setting-up-integrations).


Here are a few examples of ways some Airkit builders have recently integrated their apps with external platforms.


### [Reusability integrates with Zendesk to coordinate delivery and returns.](https://www.airkit.com/blog/airkit-and-ezr-growing-together/)







Reusability is a fast-growing, innovative company that specializes in returnable packaging programs. (Presently, Reusability services over ten thousand stores nationwide, working with big names such as Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Costco.) Like most companies dealing with rapid expansion, Reusability found themselves in desperate need to scale the way they processed information from clients. When they started out, just about everything went through their contact center – via phone calls, agents manually collected and organized the necessary information regarding how and where packaging would be returned. The more clients Reusability gained, the more agents they needed in their call center, and the more time those agents needed to spend on repetitive tasks necessary to keep data organized. The question quickly arose: "How can this information be accurately collected and organized without such high-touch human facilitation?"


An answer was found in Airkit's [out-of-the-box Zendesk integration](https://support.airkit.com/docs/zendesk-integration), which makes it possible to connect apps to Zendesk in mere minutes and without any coding required. Free exchange of information to and from Zendesk can be [easily incorporated into the flow of any app](https://support.airkit.com/reference/the-zendesk-data-operation). Reusability built out an app in Airkit and set Zendesk up as their single source of truth: all of the important information entered into their app is automatically stored and organized in Zendesk. Now, instead of directing clients to their call center whenever an order needs to be placed or logistics need to be organized, Reusability's customers are given a [link to a branded web app](https://support.airkit.com/docs/your-domain-in-airkit) that allows them to place orders and organize logistics. The same app can also filter through incoming calls via [Voice Bot](https://support.airkit.com/reference/the-start-voice-bot-action) to ensure a human representative is necessary, and directing calls to the web app if not. This saves the time of the call center agents as well as the clients, and, as an added bonus, further proved to cut down on human error.

### [SkipTheDishes integrates with Salesforce to keep track of digital onboarding journeys.](https://runway.airkit.com/rs/808-SHH-991/images/AK_Case_Study_SkipTheDishes.pdf)






SkipTheDishes, also referred to as Skip, coordinates meal delivery by connecting would-be diners with over twenty-seven thousand restaurants across Canada. Like many companies in this space, demand for their services rapidly expanded when COVID-19 hit, but they found themselves constrained by the lengthy sign-up flow restaurants needed to go through in order to work with Skip.


Restaurant managers and owners work in the fast-paced, often unpredictable world of foodservice. Every moment counts, and there's rarely a large enough block of uninterrupted time to complete a lengthy onboarding process in one fell swoop, particularly if said onboarding process is inefficient or unclear. Skip had always taken pains to make this process as simple for restaurant managers as possible, and this meant painstaking manual intervention: the team at Skip would regularly sort through different CRMs and databases in order to form a complete picture of where each restaurant was in their onboarding process, follow-up appropriately, and provide each customer with a tailored experience. With the spike in demand, however, the team at Skip quickly found themselves overwhelmed. They needed to find a way to maintain their personalized onboarding experience without requiring such high levels of manual research and intervention.  


Skip's solution was to invest in a user-friendly, omnichannel way for restaurants to join their platform using Airkit. Via Airkit's [out-of-the-box Salesforce Integration](https://support.airkit.com/docs/create-a-salesforce-lead), Skip built an onboarding app (capable of interfacing with restaurants via both [web app](https://support.airkit.com/docs/web-flows) and [SMS](https://support.airkit.com/reference/the-start-chat-bot-action)) that connects restaurants’ onboarding information to Skip's own Salesforce instance, automatically organizing each restaurants' onboarding information in one place. This allows Skip’s sales team to keep track of where restaurants are in their journey and follow up as needed – and through Airkit, even some of this follow-up process was able to be automated. It's fast and simple to set up Airkit apps to read [data from an external system in a recurring fashion](https://support.airkit.com/docs/querying-and-manipulating-data-from-external-systems) and take actions – such as sending a [text](https://support.airkit.com/reference/the-start-chat-bot-action) or a [email](https://support.airkit.com/docs/sending-email-from-airkit) – accordingly. It's through a combination of automatic updates and easily-tracked records on Salesforce that Skip now keeps its partners and sales teams in the loop throughout their onboarding processes.


Perhaps most importantly, all of this was built out in a matter of months – Skip finalized their spec in May 2020, and their app was deployed the next month. Airkit's out-of-the-box tools provide the power to rapidly streamline not only the integration of third-party systems, but their operations as well.
