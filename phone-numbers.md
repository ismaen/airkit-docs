Airkit provides you complete control over the phone numbers that your apps use to send and receive both calls and text messages. For example, it's easy to [connect numbers from Twilio](https://support.airkit.com/docs/connecting-your-twilio-numbers-to-airkit) into your Airkit apps. If there are any self-imposed restrictions on the phone numbers you want associated with your brand – maybe you want every phone call from your company to have a particular area code, or you've already set up caller ID for a particular set of phone numbers – you can can use them in Airkit just as easily as you would elsewhere.


Once you've integrated a phone number with your Airkit app, you can use the built-in tools to streamline the process of automating [phone calls](https://support.airkit.com/docs/building-a-simple-voice-bot) and [text messages](https://support.airkit.com/docs/building-a-simple-chat-bot) as part of a [user's Journey](https://support.airkit.com/docs/journeys). You can walk callers through an established flow, respond immediately to incoming texts, and even set [timers](https://support.airkit.com/reference/the-create-timer-action) to send reoccurring or individual follow-ups. 


If a  [Journey](https://support.airkit.com/docs/journeys) begins with with an incoming phone call or text message, Airkit [automatically saves relevant information that comes with it](https://support.airkit.com/docs/information-captured-from-incoming-calls-and-sms), including the phone number of the [Actor](https://support.airkit.com/docs/actors). But it makes no difference if a user first reached out via a call, a text, or a web app – it's just as easy to send the initial text (or call) to someone as it is to respond to an incoming text (or call). Airkit has a [data type](https://support.airkit.com/reference/the-phone-variable-data-type) for phone numbers, which simplifies the process of collecting and storing phone numbers as part of each user's unique identity. Storing input as a phone number data type serves as automatic validation: only valid phone numbers will be accepted as input, and they will automatically be formatted such that they can immediately be used to make a call or text – country code included. Simply ask for each user's phone number as part of their web journey, and you'll be primed to send them any number of follow-up calls or texts.
