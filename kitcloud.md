KitCloud brings pre-configured and customizable templates to the Airkit Studio. Templates within KitCloud can be used as building blocks to accelerate the development of app building and are available across [web flows](https://support.airkit.com/docs/web-flows), voice bots, chat bots and [data flows](https://support.airkit.com/docs/data-flows).  


Templates
---------


Templates range across all different channels from capturing customer information from a basic form, collecting payments via Stripe, sending a user a text to allow for SMS opt-in, and much more.  When building with templates, they can be used as out-of-the-box solutions but should more so be a starting place to be further tailored for a customized experience. 


A template can be added to a journey wherever adding a web flow, voice bot, chat bot, or data flow is possible. Whether it is in Journey Builder, Web Builder, or Connection Builder, KitCloud is accessible across the Airkit studio.


To add a web flow template when first creating an application, select a journey starting event in Journey Builder. Then click on the '+' icon next to the starting event and select [Navigate to a Web Flow.](https://support.airkit.com/reference/navigate-to-web-flow-action) This will bring up a modal to select web templates from. Once a template is selected, the web template can be viewed and modified in Web Builder.
