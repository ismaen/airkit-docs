Airkit’s reporting feature allows you to gain insights into how your customers are utilizing your app. You can track every user interaction, from button clicks to the time it takes a user to make different decisions. These key understandings will help understand your customer and improve the quality of your app.


Different Types of Metrics
--------------------------


There are a few different kinds of metrics that you can emit from your apps.


* **Count**: an incrementing counter that represents the total number of events that occur within a journey.
* **Statistic**: a numerical value that represents an event at a specific point in time that is aggregated in a number of ways: count, sum, min, max, first, last.
* **Field**: a string value that represents an event at a specific point in time. The first and last values are aggregated.
* **Timers**: a duration between two points in time. Actions specify the start and end points within your app.

Airkit also provides you a way to export all of your metrics to a CSV so you can upload and use your existing tools. To export, click the export button in the top right corner. When the export is finished generating, you’ll see an export link available next to the original export button. Clicking on that link will allow you to download all of your data.
