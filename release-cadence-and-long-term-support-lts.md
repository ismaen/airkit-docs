### How often does Airkit release new versions?


Airkit works in an agile manner to release new features and improvements. It is common for us to push minor changes on a weekly or bi-weekly basis, and major versions on a quarterly basis.


### CXR Upgrades


The [Customer Experience Runtime (CXR)](https://support.airkit.com/docs/customer-experience-runtime-cxr-overview) powers Airkit applications, and is released in minor and major versions. If a new version is released, you'll be prompted to upgrade your app, if you wish.


Upgrading and republishing your app is recommended for **in-development projects** and any projects that wish to use the latest cutting-edge features.


For more on upgrading your app, please see the [CXR Migrations](https://support.airkit.com/docs/cxr-upgrades-and-migrations) article in the Help Center.


### Long Term Support (LTS)


Every quarter, we release a major CXR version to signify a milestone version update. These are stable runtime versions that are best used for **production applications** and **in-development projects** that will be live before our next major version release. These LTS versions are production-ready and will be supported for as long as they are needed by Airkit customers.


Please see the [Release Notes](https://support.airkit.com/docs/cxr-upgrades-and-migrations) section for more details on major and minor releases.
