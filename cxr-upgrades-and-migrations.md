CXR Migrations
--------------


### Why


TheÂ [Customer Experience Runtime](https://support.airkit.com/docs/customer-experience-runtime-cxr-overview) contains the Airkit runtime that every Airkit application uses. As Airkit improves the platform, we keep your app up to date by performing different types of migrations or asking you to perform upgrades yourself. These CXR migrations are broken down into Major vs Minor version changes.


### Major vs. Minor Version Changes


#### Major


This is when the First number changes. These changes are larger changes that occur within the platform, and sometimes require specific changes to maintain compatible to the new CXR version. Major CXR versions are supported long-term.


#### Minor


A minor version change only requires saving your Application. This migration will update your application, so be sure to test your application after any migration. These types of migrations are often minor enhancements or bug fixes to the platform.


### Upgrading Production Applications


If making a major upgrade on an application in Production, we recommend taking care to ensure your users are not affected. **[Please follow the steps in this article to set up a configuration that allows you to test before republishing to production.](https://support.airkit.com/docs/using-profiles-for-deployment-settings-and-configurations)** 


If you have questions or need assistance with your application upgrade, please contact us at [support@airkit.com](mailto:support@airkit.com).
