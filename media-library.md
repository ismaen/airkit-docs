Airkit's Media Library allows you to upload, organize, and access any piece of media you want to include in your Airkit applications. This is where you'll store everything from your [custom fonts](https://support.airkit.com/docs/working-with-custom-fonts) to the graphics you want to include in your [Web Pages](https://support.airkit.com/docs/web-flows). With all your files in one place, you can use them in tandem with other Builders to experiment with different ways to combine component pieces of media or to simply create customer Journeys that follow existing style guides.

As long as the media you want to upload is in one of the above file formats, it can be uploaded to the Media Library in two ways: you can either drag and drop files on your computer directly into the Media Library, or you can click on the **Upload** button on the upper right and select from the options provided after clicking on the cloud icon in the center. To select a file after uploading it, click the check box on the left.

## Security


Before being uploaded into the Media Library, assets are scanned for Trojans, viruses, and other malware. If it appears the asset has been corrupted or is otherwise unsafe, that asset will be rejected. 


# Using the contents of the Media Library


Uploading assets to your Media Library gives the rest of the Studio seamless access to them.


For instance, if you want an uploaded logo, graphic, or gif to appear on a Web Page, you can do so in the Web Builder by adding an [Image Web Control](https://support.airkit.com/reference/image-web-control), and then selecting the appropriate Asset URL from the **Control Properties** section of the Inspector.

Common use cases for images uploaded to the Media Library include:


* Showing where to find the serial number on a product
* Delighting users with animations
* Creating brand awareness by having your company logo in the [Header](https://support.airkit.com/docs/creating-an-app-header) of every Web Page.


# Layout of the Media Library


The Media Library always displays a list of the assets you have uploaded. At a glance, you'll be able to see the name of each file, as well as its version, its file type, its size, and the last time it was modified. To select a file, click the check box on the left of the name of the file you want to select. This will open up a box on the right that provides additional information about the selected file along with giving you a preview of what the contents look like. This is also where you can access the URI.

  <summary>What is a URI?</summary>

#### URI 

URI stands for Uniform Resource Identifier; knowing the URI associated with an asset is useful for, among other things, building out an app that [allows users digitally fill out a PDF](https://support.airkit.com/docs/working-with-existing-pdfs).
