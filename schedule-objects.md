A Schedule Object is a type of [App Object](https://support.airkit.com/docs/airdata-app-objects) with a pre-defined structure intended to capture all relevant information pertaining to a scheduled appointment. Schedule Objects are used in tandem with a [Scheduler Web Control](https://support.airkit.com/reference/scheduler-web-control); when a Schedule Object is associated with a scheduler, all relevant information collected by users from the scheduler will be automatically inserted into that Schedule Object in [AirData](https://support.airkit.com/docs/airdata).


A Schedule Object must contain the following six properties:


* **session_id** -[Text](https://support.airkit.com/reference/the-text-variable-data-type) that indicates the [Journey](https://support.airkit.com/docs/journeys) that the appointment is associated with. This corresponds the Session ID (designated **session.id**) automatically assigned as a [session-level variable](https://support.airkit.com/docs/variable-scopes) at [the start of each Journey](https://support.airkit.com/docs/standard-journey-data).
* **start_time** - A [DataTime](https://support.airkit.com/reference/the-datetime-variable-data-type) that refers to the beginning date and time of the appointment.
* **end_time** - A [DataTime](https://support.airkit.com/reference/the-datetime-variable-data-type) that refers to the ending date and time of the appointment.
* **recurrence** - A [Number](https://support.airkit.com/reference/the-number-variable-data-type) that indexes the block of time selected for the appointment. Count begins at 0 and on the first occurrence of a potential appointment window, as defined by the [Time Slots that make up the Availability Schedule](https://support.airkit.com/docs/calendar-builder) tied to the associated [Scheduler Web Control](https://support.airkit.com/reference/scheduler-web-control-Scheduler-Web-Control).
* **calendar_event_id** - [Text](https://support.airkit.com/reference/the-text-variable-data-type) that serves as an identifier for the Time Slot (as defined in the [Calendar Builder](https://support.airkit.com/docs/calendar-builder) – note that this is *not* the same as the selected block of time which is indicated by ***recurrence***) that defined the selected appointment block.
* **calendar_id** - [Text](https://support.airkit.com/reference/the-text-variable-data-type) that serves as an identifier for the particular instance of [Scheduler Web Control](https://support.airkit.com/reference/scheduler-web-control-Scheduler-Web-Control) used to make the appointment. This becomes particularly relevant in cases a [Journey](https://support.airkit.com/docs/journeys) contains multiple schedulers associated with the same Schedule Object.
