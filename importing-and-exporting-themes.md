[Themes](https://support.airkit.com/docs/working-with-themes-and-control-variants) can be imported or exported into an application within [Theme Builder](https://support.airkit.com/docs/theme-builder). This streamlines the process of creating multiple applications that will have the same look and feel, as it removes the need to rebuild out a Theme or specific Variants in Theme Builder in each application individually. 


### Importing a Theme


Themes can be imported into the Theme Builder as long as they are in the correct JSON format. Some examples of importable Themes can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VA7X4GfkyWhHfkHOR53hbarIGdWMuYeS?usp=sharing) as well as on our [Github](https://github.com/airkit/Training/tree/master/blog-assets/theme-builder).


To import a Theme saved on your computer, go to the Theme Builder and click on the 'Import' icon. You can then drag and drop the Theme onto the 'Import New Theme' box, or click on said box and select the desired file:

Once a Theme has been imported, the Variant changes can be seen immediately. Toggling over to the [Web Builder](https://support.airkit.com/docs/web-builder) will show how these changes look when applied to your app's UI.


### Exporting a Theme


Once you've created a Theme you like, you can save it as a JSON file for use in future applications. Simply click on the 'Export' icon within Theme Builder. This will download a .JSON file that contains all of the style properties from the Theme that was exported:

This saved JSON file can be imported into apps just like any of our pre-built Themes.
