This guide will walk through how to connect a Twilio Number to Airkit and be used as a Voice or SMS resource. This enables the ability to leverage the Voice and SMS capabilities within the platform, such as sending an SMS update to a user or having a journey get triggered by an inbound call.Â 

**Prerequisites:**

1.  Access to a Twilio Account
2.  Have an available number associated with the Twilio Account. See [here](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223135247-How-to-Search-for-and-Buy-a-Twilio-Phone-Number-from-Console) for guidance on how to set that up.

      ]
    }

[/block]
    

2.  Once selected, the voice resource will use the Twilio integration!
    *   **Voice Locked Behavior:** What action to take if someone calls in with the same number with a live session.
    *   **Incoming Call Launch Behavior:** What action to take if the phone number receives an incoming call.

Next Steps
---------------

Once the Twilio account is connected, it can then be used to integrate with the chat bots and voice bots in **Web Builder**. Also, when dealing with phone numbers in your app, it is best practice to use the [FORMAT_PHONE](ref:format_phone) function to ensure the phone number gets passed with the region correctly.
