Airkit is a low code platform that streamlines the process of building out digital customer experiences. 

Here's how to get started!

-------------

# Access the platform

All of the tools required to build apps in Airkit are available on our browser-based platform. If you already have access to an Airkit account, you can sign in [here](https://studio.airkit.com); otherwise, you'll need to [sign up for a free trial](https://www.airkit.com/free-trial) to make an account and access the Airkit platform.


Once logged in, you will be taken to the [Airkit Console](https://support.airkit.com/docs/console). This part of the platform allows you to configure application resources, connect external integrations, and access all applications that have been created within the relevant [Organization](https://support.airkit.com/docs/airkit-organizations). Upon first getting started, no such applications will exist. Define your first app as follows:

        "#fcf9fa"
      ],
      "caption": "Define your first app by clicking on the **Create new** button on the upper right of the **Apps** page in the Console.",
      "sizing": "smart",
      "border": false
    }
  ]
}

        "#fbf7f9"
      ],
      "sizing": "smart",
      "caption": "Name your app and click on the **Create** button to the lower right to create your new app. Note that each app stored within an Organization requires a unique name."
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
Upon creating an app, you will be taken directly to the [Airkit Studio](https://support.airkit.com/docs/studio), the interface where Airkit apps are built and edited. Specifically, you will be taken to the [Journey Builder](https://support.airkit.com/docs/journey-builder), which provides a big-picture view of how the component pieces of an app fit together. This is just one of many Builders – interfaces that allow you to construct and edit different components of apps – available in the Studio. For more information on the different Builders and their separate functionalities, see [documentation on the Builder Bar](https://support.airkit.com/docs/builder-bar).
