Airkit provides simple, streamlined means of [connecting your apps with external systems](https://support.airkit.com/docs/connecting-to-external-systems) so that you can extend the capabilities of any and all platforms you're already using. With all your external resources organized in one place, it's easy to use their functionalities in tandem: sync information from different scheduling services, send information from one API to another, or explore new ways to combine familiar features from your favorite platforms.


Right out of the box, Airkit comes with built-in integrations with common platforms like [Salesforce](https://support.airkit.com/docs/create-a-salesforce-lead), [Stripe](https://support.airkit.com/docs/creating-a-stripe-integration), and [Twilio](https://support.airkit.com/docs/connecting-your-twilio-numbers-to-airkit). Connecting your apps to your accounts in these systems only takes a few minutes. [Integrating with external calendars](https://support.airkit.com/docs/integrating-to-external-calendar-systems) is similarly quick and straightforward, so it's a breeze to [make appointments and sync schedules](https://support.airkit.com/docs/using-the-scheduler-web-control-to-reschedule-deflected-calls) through your Airkit apps. (And this goes beyond simply restricting scheduling to blocks of free time – Airkit's ability to integrate information from various calendars streamlines [enforcing TCPA](https://support.airkit.com/docs/how-to-enforce-tcpa) as well, no matter the local timezones of everyone involved.)


You're not, however, limited to Airkit's pre-built integrations. Airkit also provides the tools to [connect an app to any API](https://support.airkit.com/docs/securing-api-endpoints-with-airkit-api-tokens-and-permissions) and [make HTTP requests](https://support.airkit.com/reference/http-request-data-operation) as part of a user's [journey](https://support.airkit.com/docs/journeys). It's no problem if the API requires authentication: Airkit makes it easy to set up both [authenticated and custom integrations](https://support.airkit.com/docs/setting-up-integrations) and [use those integrations to perform outbound requests with Data Operations](https://support.airkit.com/docs/querying-and-manipulating-data-from-external-systems). Airkit also provides the tools to [receive custom payloads through either app APIs or subscriptions](https://support.airkit.com/docs/your-apis-and-systems-connect-to-airkit), triggered by events within the applications themselves.
