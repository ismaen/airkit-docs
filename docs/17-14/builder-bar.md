The **Builder Bar** is located on the leftmost side of the Airkit Studio. It provides easy access to Airkit's many Builders, the interfaces that allow you to construct and edit different components of your apps. Here, we discuss broadly what each Builder is and provide some context as to their use cases.

# [Journey Builder](https://support.airkit.com/docs/journey-builder)


The Journey Builder is the Builder that you'll be taken to automatically each time you create a new application. It provides a big-picture view of how the component pieces of your application fit together, allowing you to visualize (and modify) the macro-scale [Journey](https://support.airkit.com/docs/journeys) from start to finish. This is where you'll establish the entry points to your Airkit App, configure different [Events](doc:events) that occur within your Journey, and access [Kitcloud](https://support.airkit.com/docs/kitcloud) templates.


# [Web Builder](https://support.airkit.com/docs/web-builder)


The Web Builder provides the tools to build out the UI for web experiences, which encompass everything from the structural layout of web apps from how the app will respond to user input. This is the Builder in which Web Flows are made out of Web Pages, and where Web Pages are made out of component Web Controls.


# [Chat Bot Builder](https://support.airkit.com/docs/chat-bot-builder)


The Chat Bot Builder provides the tools create SMS experiences. This is the Builder you'll use to script outgoing texts and define how returned texts will be parsed and responded to.


# [Voice Bot Builder](https://support.airkit.com/docs/voice-bot-builder)


The Voice Bot Builder provides the tools create automated phone experiences. This is the Builder you'll use to script outgoing messages and define how responses will be parsed and acknowledged.


# [Connection Builder](https://support.airkit.com/docs/connection-builder)


The Connection Builder is designed to be your gateway to the outside world and the place where you can perform more complex data interactions; think of it as the interface that allows you to use and modify data, both internal and external. You can [connect to external services](https://support.airkit.com/docs/connecting-to-external-systems), [encrypt information](https://support.airkit.com/docs/connecting-to-external-systems), [use](https://support.airkit.com/docs/what-is-airscript?) and [transform data](https://support.airkit.com/reference/the-transform-data-operation), and [much more](https://support.airkit.com/reference/data-operation-overview).


# [Media Library](https://support.airkit.com/docs/media-library)


The Media Library provides a means to store, organize, and easily access any images, documents, audio files, and videos that you want to use or display within your app.


# [Data Builder](https://support.airkit.com/docs/data-builder)


The Data Builder has two primary functions: defining how data collected by your app will be structured (by creating custom App Objects), and accessing said data afterwards. You'll use this Builder whenever you want to build an app that collects information from external sources and organizes it internally.


# [Theme Builder](https://support.airkit.com/docs/theme-builder)


The Theme Builder provides a way make stylistic changes that apply across your entire app. Most commonly, this is used to ensure apps are branded consistently.


# [Calendar Builder](https://support.airkit.com/docs/calendar-builder)


The Calendar Builder is where you can define windows of time in which app users can schedule appointments using the [Scheduler Web Control](https://support.airkit.com/reference/scheduler-web-control). 


# [Configuration Builder](https://support.airkit.com/docs/configuration-builder)


If the Connection Builder is your gateway to the outside world, the Configuration Builder is your key to the gate. It's where you'll configure email addresses from which your app can send emails, URLs that launch your web apps, and phone numbers from which your app can make calls or send texts. It's also where you'll integrate and authenticate external systems of record.


# [Portal Builder](https://support.airkit.com/docs/portal-builder)


Portals are interfaces that allow someone to access select information from your Airkit app without giving them to access anything else. Most commonly, Portals are used internally, as they allow non-developer teams to view and even work with important data while preventing them from making any changes to the app itself by accident. The Portal Builder is where you create and edit these Portal Pages. In addition to giving you control over what data is displayed, the Portal Builder also makes it easy to streamline actions users of a Portal might want to take with the data. For more information, see [Capabilities of Portals](https://support.airkit.com/docs/capabilities-of-portals).
